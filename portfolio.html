In order to win you must answer all the questions correctly.</h3>

	<h3>This is my Scratch game called Revenge of the Cat where you play as a mouse trying to eat cheese while a cat is trying to eat you. There are different difficulties and different maps to play in, if the cat gets to you then you lose and have to restart.</h3>

	<h3>This is my NetLogo project where we analyzed and explained how the program Frogger worked and all its components along with its relation to the real world. The model simulates a frog jumping across the screen trying to get to the other side dodging the cars and water. The randomness of the model means that the cars and logs in the river are randomly placed and the speed is randomly chosen.</h3>
